<h1> zawadi food supply</h1>
          <p>
    Hey! from sow coders
    My name is Tumiso Grace and I am aged  12years and I love dancing.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ApG10i4EP14" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>When I saw the people of my village suffering I knew i had to step up to help the community.<br>They
    suffered from lack of food.
This may  cause disorder in the village by
                  1.high crime rate
                  .
<h2>Lack of food causes<\h2>
  <ol>
       <li>Hunger</li>
       <li>Loss of life</li>
       <li> Unemployment</li>
       </p>
  <P>
    It is devastating seeing children on the streets begging for food so it why I decided to start this idea.

       My solution to this problem is to start a restaurant that supply food to
  the street families not only near my village but also to make it a country wide program. A waste material truck will be moving around town
  collecting the waste material for growing food ,so that will not only earn me a living but also clean the environment.
  Lactating mothers and childen will be provided with a lot of food rich in iron and other mierals.

         <h1>VISION</h1>  We want to provide quality food to all street families so that we ensurelife as we know it.
         <h1>MISSION</h1> We must abolish hunger to sastain our community.
